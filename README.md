# Stock Screener UI Design

This is a React + Vite application for the Stock Screener UI. The original design is available at https://www.figma.com/design/C855gkWLeVMjLUgiXqCSUz/Stock-Screener-UI-Design.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)

### First Time Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (or `npm i` - both commands do the same thing)

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Or manually navigate to that URL

### Daily Development

Just run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! The server will start and your browser will refresh automatically when you make changes.

## 📚 Detailed Instructions

For a complete beginner-friendly guide with explanations, see [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## 🛠️ Available Commands

- `npm install` - Install all dependencies (first time only, or when dependencies change)
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot-reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production (creates optimized files in `build/` folder)

## 📝 Notes

- **No compilation needed!** Vite automatically compiles your code when you run `npm run dev`
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Changes appear instantly in the browser
- **Dependencies:** Only need to run `npm install` once (or when package.json changes)
